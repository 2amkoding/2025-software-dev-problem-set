## What it is ho
variables that represent the different positions of indices in an Array, LinkedLists, or String.
To efficiently compare elements without relying on Nested Loops (higher time complexity).


[0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
[L           R ]

## Types of Two Patterns
1. Converging Pointers
Pointers start at opposite ends and move inwards
until condition is met OR pointers meet. 

2. Parallel Pointers
Pointers start at the same side and move the same way.
R is used to explore new information
L is used to track progress or maintain constraints

3. Trigger-Based Pointers
R is moved independantly until condition is met 
Then L is moved to find additional information
